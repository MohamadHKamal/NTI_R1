# **🛡️ Face De-Identification in Videos** 

> **🎭 Replacing real identities with synthetic faces while preserving natural expressions and motion.**

## **🎯 Goal: Protect privacy in video data while keeping content realistic and useful.**

## **⚙️ How it works:** 

  - **👀 Detect and track faces frame-by-frame.** 
  - **🧠 Use GANs / Autoencoders to generate synthetic faces.** 
  - **🎬 Apply Face Landmark & Motion Tracking to keep expressions and movements aligned.**
  - **🖌️ Blend seamlessly into the video with image inpainting.**

## **✨ Why it’s different: No identity leakage, unlike blurring or face-swapping.** 

## **🌍 Applications: Healthcare, surveillance, and privacy-safe media sharing.**
